                                     ansible_playbook_for_launching_EC2
                                     
The whole playbook is about provisoning an EC2 instance using ansible playbook. In this playbook few places need to be edited manually, 
as we need to keep two environment (production and staging) using same playbook.

The image:    This need to be changed to custom image id as we are using t2.micro instance the image should be supporting HVM 

The region:   This need to be customized according to the region which is used.

The tag name: This is where env is specified if we are launching instance in production env , then the tag name should be name_tag: "production"
              else if we are launching instance in staging env then the tag name should be name_tag: "staging"
              
dest:         This is where custom hosts details has been maintained. I am keeping two separate hosts file for production and staging env
              I have created a folder named inventory,  created two folders named production and staging, inside where i am keeping the respective hosts files. 
              The entries all are automated just need to rename hosts-production and hosts-staging to hosts and place the files in respective enviroment folders.
              NOTE: need to specify the exact path where the files has been placed inside the playbook
              
hosts:        There we need to place the value same as that of tag name, based on that ec2 has been configured. 
              NOTE: The hosts entry at the bottom of the playbook only need to be edited. eg: " - name: Configure instance hosts: production "
              for eg:- if we are launching an EC2 instance in production env we need to set  hosts: production 
                       if its staging hosts: staging 
                       
src=          The flask app has been saved in a file and need to provide exact path where the file need to be copied should be specified
              NOTE: i have used flask default port 5000 if this required to be customised please remember to change the port specified to be opened, to be customised.
              
The parameters like image , region , dest , src are need to be set one time, The tagname and hosts need to be altered according to the requirement
